The theory files
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
People interested in building learning systems based on metagame
should pay attention to the player theory files, which define
the class of symmetric chess-like games in a very declarative
way.  I'll have more documentation about this soon, but for now
these files are following ones, in the Metagame/play directory:

	 parse.pl matches.pl boards.pl legal.pl goals.pl
