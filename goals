- Extend? METAGAME game design workbench.
- METAGAME doesn't really deal with fairness; only generates symmetrical games.
- if we translate from METAGAME output to gdl, we can test games for fairness
  with eg cadiaplayer (assuming it compiles); note that many GGPs are "bad" at
  chess-likes.
- ideally, have some sort of meta-METAGAME for designing fair games (with some
  kind of focus?)
