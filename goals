- Extend? METAGAME game design workbench.
- METAGAME doesn't really deal with fairness; only generates symmetrical games.
- if we translate from METAGAME output to gdl, we can test games for fairness
  with eg cadiaplayer (assuming it compiles); note that many GGPs are "bad" at
  chess-likes.
- ideally, have some sort of meta-METAGAME for designing fair games (with some
  kind of focus?)

----

- Chess-like game generator.
- Start with METAGAME-style syntax specifying max board size, max piece #, some
  general rules.
- Feed to game generator, which outputs valid GDL describing a game that meets
  specifications.

-- Start by translating the basic concepts of METAGAME into GDL: board size,
   board-ness, movements, piece ownership...

-- Will need to define board boundaries, directions, how movement works.
