Generator README

Generator uses genetic algorithms!

Run using:
make
make run

The code will create random sets of chess pieces. After converting the piece
movement logic to GDL, the program starts up GGP servers and CadiaPlayers
to play the actual games, placing pieces on the board before starting. We
use the outcomes of the games to determine fitness, and use genetic algorithms
to pick which sets of pieces to keep for the next round.

Requires:
gson-2.8.0
cadiaplayer-3.0 (player used for evaluating games)
ggp-base (master used to run games)

TODOS:

getCost() -> move from Move to Piece?
Hookup to cadiaplayer

Fix directories in Generator -> don't use your own, use relative!

- Base/input clauses? (still don't quite understand how those work)
- Check over GDL to make sure it's all good.
