Generator README

Generator uses genetic algorithm hopefully!

Run using
javac -cp ".:gson-2.8.0.jar" *.java
java -cp ".:gson-2.8.0.jar" Generator

Requires gson-2.8.0 java library.

TODOS:

getCost() -> move from Move to Piece?
Hookup to cadiaplayer

Fix directories in Generator -> don't use your own, use relative!

- Base/input clauses? (still don't quite understand how those work)
- Check over GDL to make sure it's all good.
