Generator README

Generator uses genetic algorithm hopefully!

Run using
javac -cp ".:gson-2.8.0.jar" *.java
java -cp ".:gson-2.8.0.jar" Generator

TODOS:

getCost() -> move from Move to Piece?
Hookup to cadiaplayer

Fix directories in Generator -> don't use your own, use relative!

- Finish handling placement phase in GDL.
- Go over state change logic.
- Get king, endgame stuff into GDL.
- Base/input clauses? (still don't quite understand how those work)
- finish up (& possibly rearrange) init clauses.
